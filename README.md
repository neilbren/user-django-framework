# Django Project on Centos 7

Requirements

Create a vagrant project that will:
1. Launch a Linux VM (Centos 7)
2. Update all packages + reboot VM
3. Copy and Configure a python application that provides a simple REST API service - implement some simple CRUD tasks (create, update and delete) of data in the service
4. Forward ports so you can access the VM httpd port locally.
5. Then do a demo of it for the review, as we can't always get it to run locally
